```

### State Management
The application uses NgRx for predictable state management with the following structure:
- **Characters State** - Character data, search params, pagination
- **Favorites State** - User's favorite characters
- **Auth State** - User authentication and session management

### API Integration
- **External API** - [An API of Ice and Fire](https://anapioficeandfire.com) for character data
- **Internal API** - Node.js backend for user management and favorites

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm 9 or higher
- Docker (optional, for containerized development)

### Development Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development servers (frontend + backend)
npm run start:full

# Run frontend only
ng serve

# Run backend only
npm run backend

# Run tests
npm test                 # Unit tests
npm run test:coverage    # Unit tests with coverage
npm run e2e             # E2E tests
npm run cypress:open    # Open Cypress test runner
```

### Code Quality
```bash
# Linting
npm run lint

# Code formatting
npm run format
npm run format:check

# Security audit
npm audit
```

### Docker Development
```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up

# Build and run production images
docker-compose up --build

# Run specific service
docker-compose up frontend
```

## Testing Strategy

### Two-Tier Testing Approach

#### 1. Puppeteer Quick Validation (MANDATORY)
**Purpose:** Immediate smoke testing after Docker deployment
**When:** After `docker-compose up --build` completes
**Tests:**
- Application loads and renders correctly
- Main navigation and routing functionality
- Search and filtering capabilities
- Mobile responsiveness
- Error handling and loading states

#### 2. Cypress Comprehensive Testing
**Purpose:** Full regression testing and edge case coverage
**Scope:**
- Complete user flows and navigation
- Form validation and error handling
- Authentication and protected routes
- Component interactions and state management
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Accessibility compliance

### Running Tests
```bash
# Unit tests
npm test

# E2E tests
npm run cypress:run

# Puppeteer validation (after Docker deployment)
node scripts/puppeteer-validation.js

# All tests in CI environment
npm run test:ci
```

## Deployment

### Environment Configuration
The application supports multiple environments with proper configuration:

**Development** (`environment.ts`)
```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  apiUrl: 'https://anapioficeandfire.com/api',
  backendUrl: 'http://localhost:3000/api',
  enableLogging: true
};
```

**Production** (`environment.prod.ts`)
```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: true,
  apiUrl: 'https://anapioficeandfire.com/api',
  backendUrl: 'https://your-api.com/api',
  enableLogging: false
};
```

### Docker Deployment
```bash
# Production deployment
docker-compose up --build

# Development with hot reload
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up

# Scale services
docker-compose up --scale frontend=2 --scale backend=2
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
The project includes a comprehensive GitHub Actions pipeline:

1. **Code Quality & Security**
   - ESLint and Prettier checks
   - Security vulnerability scanning
   - Dependency auditing

2. **Testing**
   - Unit tests with coverage reporting
   - End-to-end testing with Cypress
   - Puppeteer deployment validation

3. **Build & Deployment**
   - Multi-stage Docker builds
   - Container security scanning
   - Automated deployment to staging/production

## Security

### Security Measures Implemented
- **Input Validation** - All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **XSS Prevention** - Content Security Policy and output encoding
- **Authentication** - JWT-based secure authentication
- **HTTPS Enforcement** - Secure communication in production
- **Dependency Scanning** - Regular security audits of dependencies
- **Container Security** - Trivy scanning of Docker images

### Security Headers
```nginx
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self' ...
```

## Performance

### Optimization Strategies
- **Lazy Loading** - Route-based code splitting
- **OnPush Change Detection** - Optimized Angular change detection
- **Service Workers** - Caching and offline support

## RL Logs

All project generations produce an RL log (`/logs/rl_history.json`) recording agent decisions, test results, errors, and user feedback. These logs are used to improve future project generation quality via reinforcement learning. The RL logs include detailed Puppeteer test results with screenshots and step-by-step validation.

If you provide feedback or corrections, they will help make future code even better!
